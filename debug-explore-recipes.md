# Debug Analysis: Recipe Options Coupling Issue

## Current Status
- User reports Recipe Options buttons still trigger card expansion
- Console shows chevron collapse being triggered when clicking Recipe Options
- Multiple debugging attempts have failed

## Evidence from Console Logs
```
Console.js:61 ðŸ”§ COLLAPSE: Chevron up clicked - collapsing card
Console.js:61 âœ… Chef's Choice - State: {...}
Console.js:61 âœ… Create Dishes - State: {...}
```

## Analysis
The logs clearly show that the chevron button is being triggered when Recipe Options are clicked. This suggests:

1. **DOM Event Bubbling**: Recipe Options buttons are somehow triggering parent/ancestor click events
2. **Element Overlap**: Recipe Options buttons may be overlapping with chevron buttons
3. **Event Delegation**: There might be event delegation happening that's catching Recipe Options clicks

## Next Steps
1. Create isolated test page to verify if the issue exists outside the main component
2. Inspect the actual DOM structure to see if there's element overlap
3. Add event.stopPropagation() to Recipe Options buttons
4. Check if there's any event delegation in parent components

## File Size
- explore-recipes.tsx: Large file (need to check line count)
- Complexity may be contributing to the issue
