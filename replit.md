# NutraGenie - AI-Powered Recipe Assistant

## Overview

NutraGenie is a mobile-first web application that serves as a personal AI chef assistant. It helps users discover recipes, get cooking guidance, and track their culinary progress. The app features an interactive chat system with AI chef personalities, personalized recipe recommendations based on dietary preferences, and gamification elements to encourage cooking.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state, localStorage for client state
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **API Style**: REST API with JSON responses
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **Session Management**: Memory-based storage with fallback to database

### Mobile-First Design
- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices (393px width reference)
- Touch-friendly interfaces with appropriate spacing
- Custom CSS variables for brand colors (green tones and warm neutrals)

## Key Components

### User Management
- User registration with nickname, age group, phone number, and avatar selection
- Comprehensive dietary profile with:
  - Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, keto, etc.)
  - Health conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular, kidney, blood pressure, cancer, bone health)
  - Fitness goals (build muscle, lose weight, endurance, wellness)
  - Food dislikes and preferences
  - Allergies and serious restrictions
  - Additional notes for personalized nutrition
- Chef personality selection (e.g., Chef Antoine - Precise & Classic)
- Progress tracking with cooking points, purchase points, and streak counters

### Recipe System
- Recipe database with categories (quick, healthy, dessert)
- Recipe metadata including cook time, servings, calories, difficulty
- Ingredient lists and step-by-step instructions
- Rating system and user preferences

### AI Chat Integration
- OpenAI GPT-4o integration for AI chef responses
- Context-aware conversations based on recipe and chef personality
- Real-time cooking assistance and guidance
- Message history persistence

### Health Analytics & Nutrition Tracking
- Comprehensive nutrition logging by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack)

- Health metrics monitoring (weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, energy level, sleep, water intake, exercise)
- Personalized nutrition goals and daily progress tracking
- Health trend analysis and visualization over time
- Integration with dietary restrictions and health conditions

### Gamification Features
- Cooking points system (5 points per completed recipe)
- Purchase tracking and badges
- Weekly streaks and challenge completion
- Achievement system with visual progress indicators

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration Flow**: 
   - Splash Screen → Create Account (Single consolidated screen with 3 card sections)
   - Card 1: Profile (Avatar Selection + Nickname + Age Group)
   - Card 2: AI Chef (Chef Avatar Selection + Chef Nickname + Personality)
   - Card 3: Phone Verification (Phone Entry + Code Verification with 1234)
   - Visual feedback with checkmarks and progress indicators
   - Then → Dietary Preferences → Recipe Dashboard

2. **Recipe Discovery**: Browse by category → Filter/Search → Recipe Details → Start Cooking
3. **Cooking Assistance**: Recipe Instructions → AI Chat Support → Progress Tracking → Completion
4. **Profile Management**: View achievements → Track progress → Update preferences

### State Management Pattern
- **API-Driven Architecture**: ALL DATA IS API DRIVEN - components fetch data from backend APIs, not mock/placeholder data
- **Independent Component Architecture**: Each component fetches its own data from APIs without frontend dependencies
- Components maintain minimal shared state and avoid cross-component data dependencies
- Server state managed by TanStack Query with automatic caching per component
- User data persisted in localStorage for offline access with API synchronization
- Real-time updates through optimistic updates and cache invalidation
- All workflows draw data from APIs rather than component interdependencies
- Voice Cooking is the single comprehensive cooking interface for all cooking activities

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **OpenAI API**: AI chef personality and cooking assistance
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL hosting
- **Drizzle ORM**: Type-safe database operations
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives
- **TanStack Query**: Server state management

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for server code
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the stack

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Vite dev server for client-side development
- Node.js Express server for API development
- Database migrations using Drizzle Kit
- Hot module replacement for rapid development

### Production Build
- Client: Vite build output to `dist/public`
- Server: ESBuild bundle to `dist/index.js`
- Static file serving through Express
- Environment variables for API keys and database connections

### Database Management
- Schema definitions in `shared/schema.ts`
- Migrations generated and applied via `drizzle-kit`
- Connection pooling through Neon's serverless driver

### Environment Configuration
Required environment variables:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API access
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)
