I would like to redesign the Explore Recipe Options Screen

On Navigating to Explore Recipe Options 
It should display 3 card 

1) Preferences and Pantry Ingredients
2) Recipe Options
3) Summary Card 


Preferences and Pantry Ingredients Card
To have 3 tabs on top as shown below( check the take out screen, this what was created there for reference)
Look at the take out screen and lets make the 3 tabs or buttons to have the same size on this page on its own card

NEW CARD 
Create a new Card
Title of the card: Preferences and Pantry Ingredients 
The three buttons in the card are 
1) Diet.  2) Meal.  3) Pantry  
Each of these buttons to be attached to another card 

Diet will be connected to Card ( Your dietary Preferences- This is an existing card). Do not change design of the card- data from “ Your dietary preferences is being populated here)

Meal will be connected to Card ( Meal Preferences This is an  existing card) Do not change design of the card

Pantry will be connected to ( Select Pantry Ingredients card, this is an existing card )

User can navigate between these three buttons and able see the resultant cards
We need to some how force user to go to Meal tabs and , Update or confirm Meal Preferences ( Serving Size, Cuisine and Meal Type are mandatory fields) ( maybe check tick to indicate complete)
and followed by Pantry and updating pantry ingredients User should somehow confirm that its complete( maybe check tick to indicate complete)

NEW CARD
Create new card
 Title:  Summary for XXXXX ( Name of the User Avatar)
While user completes completing the above two cards ( Meal Preferences and Pantry Ingredient)
Data in the Summary card is appended 
This is a new card - It should sit below the card “Pantry Options”

Title Summary
Subtitle : Meal Preferences - display list of meal preferences captured from earlier in to this card in clean 2 rows
Subtitle : Pantry Ingredients : Display list of ingredients in the pantry in rows no shading
Put a separator line where needed
The card can have 2 buttons ( Grocery List) Edit Preferences) 

Coming back two things happen
Data gets appended to Summary card 
Preferences card slides  down below the Summary card - after 5 seconds 
When navigating back to the Explore Recipe Options from any screen - The Card Layout resets
That would allow user to edit data 


Grocery List will be connected to Grocery List Card
Edit Preferences will move Preferences and Pantry Ingredients  to be the top most card



changes to card Named : Recipe Options 
Remove Pantry items button 
And remove the connection to the card
Instead lets have 4 buttons 
1) Pantry Dishes - Connected to the card Dishes that can be cooked from your pantry Ingredients
2) Chefs Choice -  Connected to Chefs Choice of dishes personalized for you
3) Create a Dish - Connected to create your custom dish on creating a recipe connects to  Recipe Variations for Burger 
4)Take-Out:   - This will be connected to a new card that displays 6 dishes ( Same layout we are using for dishes
