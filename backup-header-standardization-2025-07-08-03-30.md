# NutraGenie Project Backup - Header Standardization Complete
**Backup Date:** July 8, 2025 - 3:30 AM
**Session Focus:** Comprehensive Header Standardization and Background Theme Consistency

## Major Accomplishments This Session

### 1. Complete Header Standardization
- **Unified Branding:** All screens now use consistent "NutraGenie" text-2xl font-bold

- **Layout Consistency:** Flex layout with proper spacers for perfect centering across all pages
- **Typography:** h1 text-2xl font-bold, subtitle text-lg font-semibold with mt-1 spacing

### 2. Navigation Flow Optimization

### 3. Background Theme Consistency

    <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-purple-300 mt-1">Screen Title</p>
  </div>
  <div className="w-8"></div>
